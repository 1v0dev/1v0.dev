[Wallos](https://wallosapp.com/) is an app for tracking subscriptions. I have several for 
things like Netflix and Spotify, so I needed a place to track them and Wallos works great.
It's very easy to self-host since they provide docker container and I had it up and running
in a few minutes. There is a bunch of settings you can configure to track various stuff like currencies
and payment methods. Very useful feature is the ability to configure notifications
about the upcoming due date or future cancellation date.
